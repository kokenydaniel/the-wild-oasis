## About The Project

Welcome to The Wild Oasis!

Its aim is to simplify and optimize cabin management and bookings. With the help of authentication, it ensures security and a personalized user experience for accommodation workers.

Main functions:

User management: The system provides the possibility to add new employees and change the settings of existing users.

Cabin Management: You can easily maintain cabin data and cabin capacity.

Management of reservations: The system allows easy management of reservations, including check-in and check-out processes. Extra services, such as adding breakfast, can be easily managed in the booking details.

Dashboard: On the main page there is a comprehensive dashboard that shows the arrivals and departures of the day. We display occupancy and income through graphs, so you can quickly get an overview of the accommodation's current performance.

Security and Privacy:
The system has advanced security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure the security of users' data, for which Supabase has been used.

## Built in

1. Vite
2. React
3. Styled component
4. React Router
5. React Query
6. Supabase

## Log in

## Create new employee / user

You can create a new employee / user and then you will get a confirmation email what you have to confirm. After that you can log in with your account.

## What I learned

I learned a lot about using the React framework and the Supabase database by being involved in building a complex application. I summarize the main lessons below:

1. React framework:
Using components: I delved into the basic principles of the React component and learned how to effectively build and manage parts of the application using modular components. This not only makes the structure of the code more transparent, but also enables reusability.

State and Props: I understand the importance of managing state and properties (props) and effectively use these tools to make the application dynamic.

2. Supabase database:
Data management: I learned how to efficiently integrate and manage data with the Supabase database. Various operations like querying, inserting, updating and deleting data are now part of my practice.

Real-time features: I enjoyed the real-time data updates offered by Supabase and managed to incorporate them into the application, which made it even more interactive.

3. Application building process:
Design and implementation of a complex application: I learned how to design and implement a complex application using components and data management together. The application is versatile and easily extensible by taking full advantage of React and Supabase.

Debugging and Optimization: While building the app, I gained experience in debugging and optimization, which are key to creating an efficient and user-friendly app.

These lessons not only improved my technical skills, but also my thinking in application development processes.
